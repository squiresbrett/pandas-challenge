# pandas-challenge

This challenge was very straightforward. Thankfully, I didn't need to use very much outside help for this one, as I just went back over the zoom videos from the prior week to help me out. Pandas and Jupyter notebook seems much easier to grasp for me rather than python, just being able to break it down step by step is a much more relaxing and intuitive expreience rather than wondering what little sintax errror I made in my huge block of code. Thank the lord for Jupyter notebook!
